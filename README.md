**💡 Tips & Tricks (Exam Strategy)**
-Skip Performance-Based Questions (PBQs) first
-PBQs are time-consuming and require deeper analysis. When the exam starts, flag all PBQs and move on.
-Focus on multiple-choice questions first
-Answering multiple-choice questions early helps:
-Secure quick points
-Build confidence
-Manage time more effectively
-Return to PBQs after completing all multiple-choice questions

Once the easier questions are done, you can:
-Allocate focused time to PBQs
-Work without time pressure
-Use remaining time efficiently
-Use elimination techniques
-Remove clearly incorrect answers to improve odds on tougher questions.

**Watch the clock, but don’t rush**
-Aim to finish multiple-choice questions with at least 25–30 minutes remaining for PBQs.

**Read questions carefully**
-CompTIA often uses wording like “best,” “most secure,” or “first action” — these keywords matter.
