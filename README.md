**💡 Tips & Tricks (Exam Strategy)**    
-Skip Performance-Based Questions (PBQs) first     
-PBQs are time-consuming and require deeper analysis. When the exam starts, flag all PBQs and move on.     
-Focus on multiple-choice questions first     
-Answering multiple-choice questions early helps:    
-Secure quick points     
-Build confidence     
-Manage time more effectively   
-Return to PBQs after completing all multiple-choice questions     

Once the easier questions are done, you can:    
-Allocate focused time to PBQs   
-Work without time pressure    
-Use remaining time efficiently     
-Use elimination techniques    
-Remove clearly incorrect answers to improve odds on tougher questions.      

**Watch the clock, but don’t rush**    
-Aim to finish multiple-choice questions with at least **25–30 minutes** remaining for PBQs.     

**Read questions carefully**          
-CompTIA often uses wording like **“best,”** **“most secure,”** or **“first action”** — these keywords matter.
